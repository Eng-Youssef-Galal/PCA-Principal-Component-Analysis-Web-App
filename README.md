# What is PCA
The Principal Component Analysis is a popular unsupervised learning technique for reducing the dimensionality of data. It increases interpretability yet, at the same time, it minimizes information loss. It helps to find the most significant features in a dataset and makes the data easy for plotting in 2D and 3D.

# Steps for PCA Algorithm
1.Standardize the data: PCA requires standardized data, so the first step is to standardize the data to ensure that all variables have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

2.Calculate the covariance matrix: The next step is to calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data. This matrix shows how each variable is related to every other variable in the dataset.

3.Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues: The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are then calculated. The eigenvectors represent the directions in which the data varies the most, while the eigenvalues represent the amount of variation along each eigenvector.

4.Choose the principal components: The principal components are the eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues. These components represent the directions in which the data varies the most and are used to transform the original data into a lower-dimensional space.

5.Transform the data: The final step is to transform the original data into the lower-dimensional space defined by the principal components.
